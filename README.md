# Contraceptive_Project
This is a group final research project that me and 2 other classmates (Beeya Kim, Michael Aydin) had done for DS100 (Principles and Techniques of Data Science). We were given a dataset of over 1000 wives who took one of three different contraceptive types, along with data about their and their husbands' education levels, number of children, whether or not they were working, etc. We performed tasks related to EDA and data visualizations to observe any correlations between other features and the 3 contraceptive types, and using them to refine a new model from different types (LogisticRegresion, DecisionTree, RandomForest) based on the cross-validation and accuracy scores.
